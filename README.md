JavaScript tutorial for beginners from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ. \ The javascript code is directly from the tutorial. \
I refactored the html/css layout slightly and made it responsive at medium breakpoint.\
You can grab the original from Beau Carnes, https://github.com/beaucarnes/simon-game/blob/master/js/index.js
